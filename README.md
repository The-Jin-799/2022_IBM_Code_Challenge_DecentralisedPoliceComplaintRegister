# Decentralised Police Complaint Register

A Transparent solution against fraudulent denial of police complaints based on blockchain.



## Problem Statement
In some cases if the complaint is against some people in power. These complaints are not taken seriously or not even filed an FIR. The trust in police service of the country decreases in cases like these.

The proposed system eliminates the need for trust. The complainer can track the complaint status and the system protects the FIR and complaint from tampering or destruction.
